Recipe cards with visual indicators for difficulty levels

****Pages**

Detailed recipe view with ingredients, instructions, and nutrition info
User authentication (login/register)
User profile with tabs for created recipes, saved recipes, and settings
Recipe creation form with dynamic fields for ingredients and instructions

**Features**

User authentication flow with protected routes
Recipe browsing with filter and search capabilities
Recipe creation with image upload
Comments and likes on recipes
User profiles with recipe management


**Backend (Express.js)
API Endpoints**

Authentication (register, login, logout, get current user)
Recipe CRUD operations
Comments and likes functionality
User profile and recipe management



**Database Models**

User model for authentication
Recipe model with detailed fields
Comment model for recipe discussions


**Features**

1.JWT authentication with secure cookies

3.Filtering and sorting of recipes
4,Relationship management between users, recipes, and comments
The application is now running in development mode. You can explore the different pages and features. In a production environment, you would need to set up a MongoDB database and configure the environment variables properly.
